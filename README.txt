Unofficial Aranet4 app with support for the Homey Pro (Early 2023).
The Aranet4 air quality monitor can help you keep the indoor air healthy. Good air quality helps people maintain their general well-being, comfort, and productivity.
Additionally, CO2 monitoring can be a good proxy of the ventilation of a shared indoor space. CO2 is a gas produced when we exhale, so its concentration can be a good indicator of insufficient ventilation, as well as aerosols and possibly virus particles potentially lingering in the air.
